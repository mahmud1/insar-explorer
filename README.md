# InSAR Explorer

## Description
InSAR Explorer is a QGIS plugin for interactive visualization and analysis of InSAR time-series data. It supports the documented preparation workflows for [SARvey](https://github.com/luhipi/sarvey), [MintPy](https://github.com/insarlab/MintPy), [MiaplPy](https://github.com/insarlab/MiaplPy), [GMTSAR](https://topex.ucsd.edu/gmtsar/), [SARscape](https://www.sarmap.ch/index.php/software/sarscape/), and [EGMS](https://egms.land.copernicus.eu/).
Check the full [documentation](https://docs.insar-explorer.eodeck.com) for supported data formats and preparation instructions.

## How to use
### Install the plugin
Install InSAR Explorer from the QGIS Plugin Repository. Search for `InSAR Explorer` in the QGIS Plugin Manager and click `Install`.
More information about installation methods is available in the [documentation](https://docs.insar-explorer.eodeck.com/en/latest/#installation).

### Prepare time-series data
Prepare the time-series data as a supported vector or raster layer in the [required format](https://docs.insar-explorer.eodeck.com/en/latest/#data-structure).
Preparation instructions are available for the [documented processing workflows](https://docs.insar-explorer.eodeck.com/en/latest/#data-preparation).
Sample data are available from the [documentation](https://docs.insar-explorer.eodeck.com/en/latest/#sample-data).

### Explore time series
Open a supported vector or raster InSAR layer, launch InSAR Explorer, and use the Target/Reference selection tools to interactively inspect time series. Selected time series can be retained and compared, styled, fitted, and exported.
See the full [usage documentation](https://docs.insar-explorer.eodeck.com/en/latest/#usage) for the current workflow.
